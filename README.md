## Introduction üé¢

This is a comprehensive library management system built using Flask, Peewee ORM, and other Python libraries. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing books, members, transactions, and administrative tasks.  The system emphasizes security with password hashing, and offers features like membership management, book borrowing/returning, report generation, and more.

## Features ‚≠ê

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login for members and administrators using bcrypt for password hashing.
*   **Book Management:** Add, edit, delete, and view books with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, etc.  Filtering by genre and search by author/title are also implemented.
*   **Membership Management:** Create, edit, delete, and view member profiles, including membership renewal functionality.
*   **Transaction Management:** Issue and return books, track borrowing history, and generate printable receipts.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Overview of key statistics like total books, members, and borrowed books.
*   **Reporting:** Generate PDF reports of issued books for members.
*   **Search and Filter:** Search for books by title or author, and filter by genre.
*   **Image Integration:**  Images are displayed on various pages for visual appeal.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with a framework like Bootstrap for styling)
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask framework)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (using Peewee ORM)
*   **PDF Generation:** WeasyPrint
*   **Security:** bcrypt for password hashing

## Installation üîß

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[username]/Library_management_application.git
    cd Library_management_application/
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create requirements.txt listing all dependencies
    ```

4.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Create a PostgreSQL database.
    *   Set the database credentials in a `.env` file (see `models.py` for the expected format).

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run 
    ```

## Usage üöÄ

1.  **Home Page:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.  You should see the home page with the welcome message and featured books (with images).

2.  **Apply for Membership:** Click on the "Apply for Membership" link and fill out the form (with an image of the form).

3.  **Books Section:** Browse books, filter by genre, and search by title or author (with an image demonstrating filtering and search).

4.  **Login:** Members can log in to view their borrowing history and perform actions like renewing their membership. Administrators can access the admin panel.

5.  **Admin Panel:** Access the admin panel to manage books, members, and transactions.

6.  **Borrowing/Returning Books:** Use the transaction forms (with image) to issue and return books.

7.  **Print Receipt:** After issuing books, download a PDF receipt with member details and a list of issued books.

8.  **Membership Renewal:** Use the membership renewal form (with image) to update membership expiry dates.

## Database Schema üóÑÔ∏è

The database consists of the following tables:

*   **Admin:** Stores administrator user credentials.
*   **Book:** Stores book details (title, author, ISBN, genre, image URL, etc.).  `num_books_available` tracks the number of copies currently available.
*   **Membership:** Stores member information (name, DOB, contact details, membership type, expiry date, etc.).
*   **Transaction:** Tracks book borrowing/returning activities (member ID, book ID, issue date, return date, status).  Uses foreign keys to link to the `Membership` and `Book` tables.

(See `models.py` for a detailed schema definition using Peewee ORM.)
